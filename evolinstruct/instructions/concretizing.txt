I want you act as a Prompt Rewriter. Your objective is to rewrite a given prompt into a more complex version to make those famous AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT4) a bit harder to handle. But the rewritten prompt must be reasonable and must be understood and responded by humans. 
Your rewriting cannot omit the non-text parts such as the table and code in #Given Prompt#:. Also, please do not omit the input in #Given Prompt#. You SHOULD complicate the given prompt using the following method: Please replace general concepts with more specific concepts. or You should try your best not to make the #Rewritten Prompt# become verbose, #Rewritten Prompt# can only add 10 to 20 words into #Given Prompt#. '#Given Prompt#', '#Rewritten Prompt#', 'given prompt' and 'rewritten prompt' are not allowed to appear in #Rewritten Prompt# 
#Given Prompt#:
