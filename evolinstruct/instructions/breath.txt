I want you act as a Prompt Creator. Your goal is to draw inspiration from the #Given Prompt# to create a brand new prompt. 
This new prompt should belong to the same domain as the #Given Prompt# but be even more rare. The LENGTH and difficulty level of the #Created Prompt# should be similar to that of the #Given Prompt#. 
The #Created Prompt# must be reasonable and must be understood and responded by humans. '#Given Prompt#', '#Created Prompt#', 'given prompt' and 'created prompt' are not allowed to appear in #Created Prompt#. 

#Given Prompt#: 
{{ prompt }}
#Created Prompt#:
